&gt;&gt; In terms of your work at Facebook, what

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.790
are some recent projects that you've been working on?

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; So, one thing I'm really fascinated by is how information flows

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.730
through networks. So, in my early work, this was just how webpages linked

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.870
together. But, with online social networks

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.130
being such a prevalent means of communicating

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.680
these days there's a lot of transmission from individual to individual or from

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620
individual to their social network. And, there

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.000
are these things called memes which are ideas

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.370
that seemed to almost take advantage of this

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.270
to replicate themselves. So, some Facebook status updates,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.030
for example, will have a little piece of text that says copy and paste or repost

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.680
or post this so that all your friends will see if you agree with this statement.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.110
One interesting thing about memes is that they tend

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.440
to recur over time. So, sometimes you see a meme

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.250
and it's like oh, yeah, I saw that one a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.720
year ago and now it's back and how does it

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.440
come back? So, we looked at one particular meme. This

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.900
is the Moneybags meme, which says that you know, this

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.410
year, October has five Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. This happens only

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.820
once every 823 years and this is a lucky occurrence,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.770
blah, blah, blah and anyone who actually looks it up,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.910
sees that this kind of occurrence is much more frequent

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.740
and in fact, you'll have different variants of the meme.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.660
For example, here in red, you have the one that says,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.560
July has five Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. And this is true

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.160
in 2011 and if you just look at this plot, which

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.060
will, on a linear scale, show you the counts for

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.830
this meme, it may appear as though it just disappears completely

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.180
in between. So, you might think, well, maybe it's

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.130
being introduced from some other source and not Facebook.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.060
But the weird thing is that the meme is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.090
adapted to Facebook. It says, copy and paste, which doesn't

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
make so much sense for other media. So, is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080
it possible that the meme is actually staying within

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.790
Facebook but in very low numbers, and then flares

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.010
up? And so if you, instead of using a linear

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.580
scale, use a log scale here at the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.120
same time, you can see counts that are 100,000

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.880
and counts that are 10. And so here when

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.090
you look, you can see that even though there's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.130
a rapid decay in interest, it actually looks

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.195
like it's maybe parallel and you can see the

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:27.040
meme persisting in low numbers. And then different variants,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.090
perhaps being prompted by a resurgence of this meme,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.660
then subsequently occurring. These were done in ggplot, just with

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.220
a simple line geome and grouping by the particular meme

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.080
variant and then rescaling the ax, the y-axis to log in one of the versions.
