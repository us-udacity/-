00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.590
My name is Jessica Kirkpatrick and
I am a data scientist at Hired.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.840
I also write for

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.180
several women in science blogs and
I'm a mentor with Chick Tech.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.285
I chose to become a data analyst
because after I finished my PhD in

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:18.975
the astrophysics I was trying to think
of ways that i could apply my technical

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.395
skills and my data skills.

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.155
But in a way that was a bit more
down to earth than astrophysics.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.745
So i see my role as a data scientist or
a data analyst

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:33.225
is to basically help other people
in the company make decisions and

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.330
prioritize their work by using
the data that we collect.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.160
So that could mean helping someone on
our marketing team figure out if one of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.140
their campaigns is working.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.990
That could mean helping a product
manager decide whether or

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.990
not they should ship a product change.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.270
So I remember when I first started
trying to learn how to code,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.610
it was really overwhelming.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.050
And what I spent a lot of time doing
was looking at existing code that was

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.269
out there on the internet or
examples of analyses and

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.160
using those as a basis for
me to try to expand on.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.060
So there's a lot of really
great examples online.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.080
I'm kind of constantly searching on
google for how to do various things.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.210
And stack overflow has a lot
of really awesome examples of

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.380
algorithms in particular that you use
and data analytics and data science.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.400
So for me it's a lot about using
worked examples to help me work

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.250
on whatever project Iâ€™m working on and
building on those.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.430
First and foremost, it's important to
learn basic math and statistics skills,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.570
because you're going to be using those
a lot in whatever analysis you're doing.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.455
Then in terms of technical languages,
it's very important to know SQL,

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:56.025
because most data sets are going
to need to pull using SQL or

00:01:56.025 --> 00:02:00.215
some SQL-like language,
like Hadoop or MapReduce.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:05.925
Then I would recommend learning
some sort of statistical package

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:10.770
that will help you do further analysis
and further modeling of your data.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.520
You can use R,
that's one package that's popular.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.140
I like to use Python,
that's another package that's popular.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.060
But just anything where you can
take your raw data and then do

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.650
more advanced statistics and modeling
and numerical analysis on the data.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.270
What excites me about being
a data analyst is getting to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.310
be able to solve different
puzzles every day.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.620
Every day is different, every day I am
working on a new area of the business.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.160
And I'm helping people do their jobs
more effectively by using data.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.840
It's really fun,
it's always changing and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.540
it uses tons of different parts of
my brain in problem solving skills.
