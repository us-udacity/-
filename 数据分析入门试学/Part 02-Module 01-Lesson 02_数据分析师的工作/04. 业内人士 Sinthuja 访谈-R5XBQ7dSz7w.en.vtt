00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
I think data is actually really exciting.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.589
I feel like data is really just information.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.109
And so, the more information that you have,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.750
the better decision that you can make.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.094
My name is Sinthuja, and I'm a Manager of Data Analytics at Summit Public Schools.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:17.420
I've actually had a few different roles.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.715
I worked a little bit in consulting and then decided to be a teacher.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:23.759
And data was actually, just seemed like the perfect fit for me,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.170
because it makes my previous teaching experience,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.020
at working in an education company,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.684
with also a more technical aspect as well.

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:36.269
So, Summit public schools is actually a charter management organization, a nonprofit,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.835
and we have developed

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.600
our own platform that we partnered with the Chan Zuckerberg initiative.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.939
They store all the student grades data

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.684
and also how they're interacting with the platform,

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:51.344
in that database, and that's really what we use to analyze.

00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:53.804
One of the projects that I'm really excited about is

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:56.700
analyzing and tracking student performance data,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.630
and actually building tools for school leaders and teachers in

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.784
tableau and displaying that data for them to use on a weekly or daily basis.

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.879
I've actually had the privilege of doing focus groups

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:12.060
and user experience interviews with school leaders and teachers to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.375
develop an experience that they can really use to improve outcomes of their schools.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:23.114
I've seen Summit grow from both a small organization to a large,

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:27.689
and even when you're small you have to figure out a lot of things on your own of like,

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.649
how the data is structured and being able to analyze it in the correct way.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.484
But once we built the data infrastructure,

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:38.700
you still have to really be able to like think about questions on your own,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.530
and lead projects, and ask what's the next step that I want to do with this analysis.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.460
So, I think dealing with ambiguity is going to be a key part of any data analyst role.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.939
I think as long as you have like a good foundation in SQL,

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.640
and then also some statistical background,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.650
whether that could be in Python, in R,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.020
or Stata, like all of

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.784
those languages will really set you up to be a successful data analyst.

00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:05.905
And it's really just understanding a data infrastructure and

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:09.129
how your data systems are set up,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.310
and then being able to join everything and just

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.474
aggregate and analyze in a way that makes sense.

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:20.034
One of the key things that I've learned is that there is always something new to learn.

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:24.520
So, even though I feel like I've developed a lot of skill in SQL and Python,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.439
I'm always trying to figure out what's like

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.379
the next thing that I can learn to improve my skill set.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.384
I've tried a lot of different programs in order to increase my skill set, and yeah,

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:39.699
my favorite course has actually been one of the courses that I took on Udacity,

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.339
mainly because of the project based learning.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.890
I think that online learning is great,

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.944
and like you can delve into topics on your own pace,

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:51.609
but actually being able to apply it,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.580
is really where you learn a lot,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.850
and you learn what you know,

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.120
what you don't know,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.700
and also it just really stretches your thinking in a different way, and so,

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.329
Udacity's courses where they force you to kind of do that project at

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.820
the end of the unit are actually super beneficial and I would highly recommend them.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.599
I think that the data analysts role is going to be an integral part of any company,

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.079
as our society has so much access to data and it's only going to continue to grow.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.075
That if you have a data analyst background,

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:27.280
it really will set you up to be successful in any types of roles that you have later on.
