00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome to your first project.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.934
Global temperature has been a hot topic in recent years,

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:08.054
as politicians argue over climate change policy,

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:12.105
and scientists try to understand how the world's climate is actually changing.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.380
Temperature data around the world is an important part of this conversation.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.015
To measure temperature data,

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:22.054
scientists combine measurements from the air and ocean surface.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:25.734
This data is collected by weather stations on land and in the ocean.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.640
In this project, you'll analyze local and global temperature data and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.159
compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:39.000
You'll analyze the data, create a data visualization and write up your findings.
