00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.060
There's a philosophy in web development.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.830
New browser technologies
cannot break old websites.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.009
Once a site has been built with
stable web standard technologies.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.928
It should continue to work forever.

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:18.270
HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript have evolved quite a bit.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.160
We're currently on HTML version five.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.720
Hence the five there.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.000
And we're also on CSS version three,
notice the three.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we usually call these HTML5 and
CSS3.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.800
Each new version has added new
features to the markup languages.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.336
But few if any at all,
features have been removed.

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:44.835
So, any website written for
browsers in 94, 95, or really any time,

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:50.528
should look exactly the same
on browsers developed in 2016.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:54.537
As a result of adding more and
more features to these languages,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:58.370
there are lots of ways to
solve problems on the web.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.700
And here are just a few that
you'll be learning about soon.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.440
But over time, best practices change.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.950
But that doesn't mean that
yesterday's best practices just stop

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.250
working overnight.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.460
Part of being a web developer
is staying up to date and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.260
being able to discern old from new.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.940
Or last year's gold standard
from tomorrow's tech.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.980
Now, to be fair with these examples
in particular, all of these are very,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.350
very valid ways to develop websites.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.609
But there are some differences and
some features are newer than others.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.170
In fact, web technologies
are constantly changing.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.470
New ones are popping up all the time and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.920
even the stable ones are changing
on a scale of weeks, it seems like.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.450
And as I said before,
we can't possibly teach you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.790
everything that there is to know about
the world wide web's technologies.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.428
Instead, we want to teach
you how to stay up to date.

00:01:56.428 --> 00:02:01.088
We want you to develop opinions about
new technologies as they come out.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.540
And we want you to keep learning so
that you keep having fun, and

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.180
you keep building websites.
