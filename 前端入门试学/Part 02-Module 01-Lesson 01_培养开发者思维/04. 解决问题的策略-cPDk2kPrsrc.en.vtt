00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.260
Hey Mike, how many times have
you heard somebody say, wow,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.540
this was a lot harder
than i thought it'd be?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; All the time,
I think I heard you say it this morning.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.780
&gt;&gt; I think I say it a few times a week.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.650
I mean, coding no matter how long you've
been doing it, is always difficult,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.720
problems always come up.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.970
&gt;&gt; That's true,
in reality the sign of a good developer

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.760
isn't someone who's very smart.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.410
It's someone who's going to solving
problems and can persevere.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.430
You're going to run into problems,
you're going to get frustrated.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.030
There will be times you are confused.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.580
And you're going to program yourself
into a corner that seems inescapable.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.460
&gt;&gt; Whenever you run
into these situations,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.040
it's important that you keep going.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.910
And I don't mean keep going in
the sense that you just bang your

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.430
head against the wall, and
get more and more frustrated.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900
I mean going in the sense that,
day after day, little by little,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.580
you just make some progress.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.870
That's how you can get
through any problem.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.547
To help out here are a few
problem-solving strategies.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250
First off there's sleeping on it,
seriously, it's helpful.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.920
Take a break, come back fresh, and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.800
you'll be surprised to find how
much easier some problems get.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.330
You also have Google and
Stack Overflow to help out.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.060
Most of the time your errors
are going to have messages.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.970
Copy and
paste those messages into Google.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.710
And you'll be surprised to
find out how quickly you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.940
can get answers to your questions.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.440
Stack Overflow is awesome
because people vote on answers.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.530
So you can get a sense of
what strategy the community

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.800
thinks will solve a problem.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.070
Seriously, this is a great strategy and
will solve lots and lots and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.000
lots of problems for you.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.440
But hey, speaking of community, try
asking the community, you aren't alone.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.780
Remember, you're going to be learning
alongside a lot of other people.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.580
Reach out and ask for help.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.200
If you're lucky enough to know
some web developers in real life,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.460
talk to them too.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.280
They might be able to point
you in the right direction.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630
And sometimes you might need
to rethink what you're doing.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.890
When I'm working on something
complicated, I like to draw a picture.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.930
This picture is an actual drawing I made
the other night for an actual project.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.669
It's not very pretty,
it's just pencil on graph paper, but

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.370
it really doesn't have to be.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.910
Shapes, words and
arrows are often good enough.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.430
This drawing turned out to
be super helpful for me and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.520
wound up saving me a lot of work later.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.240
So it's often helpful to
get your ideas on paper and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.460
stop juggling them in your head.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.380
You'll be able to make better decisions
if you can see the whole picture.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.350
And lastly,
I want you to look at your mistakes and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.140
missteps as learning opportunities.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.450
Look at it like this,
you're never really wrong,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.820
you just aren't right, yet.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.420
&gt;&gt; That's really solid advice.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.770
I think I've done all of those
things throughout my career.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.008
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we all have.

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.875
I mean as you well know, the best thing
is at the end of the day, the feeling is

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:56.830
just absolutely incredible
when something starts to work.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.503
We want you to keep these techniques in
mind as you work on your Nanodegree and

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:01.020
beyond.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.800
&gt;&gt; You'll be evolving as you learn and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.720
get better at pushing through
the problems you face.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.940
&gt;&gt; To help you remember this,
I want you to write a quick

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.210
little reflection on how you'll push
through the challenges ahead of you.
