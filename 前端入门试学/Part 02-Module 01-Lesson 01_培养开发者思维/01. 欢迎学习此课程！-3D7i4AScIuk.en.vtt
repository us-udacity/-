Welcome to the front-end
web developer Nanodegree.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.370
I'm Mike Wales, the director for
this Nanodegree program.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.550
And I'm Cameron Pittman.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.030
I'm a Senior Content Developer
here at Udacity.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.680
Along with a few other folks, Mike and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.110
I are here to help you become
a front-end web developer.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.520
In fact you are already
on your Your way.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.330
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.170
&gt;&gt; From this point forward,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.610
we want you to call yourself
a front end web developer.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.250
Congratulations, tell your friends.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.760
&gt;&gt; I think it makes sense to not just
give you an idea of where you are in

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.060
the web development world but
when you are.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.460
&gt;&gt; Like a history lesson?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.030
&gt;&gt; Well yeah.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.080
Mike, you know this better than anybody
else, the web's been around for a while.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.140
You've been doing this since what, 92?

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.360
&gt;&gt; Pretty much, although, back then
technically it wasn't called the web.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.170
But yeah.
Early 90s [INAUDIBLE] I remember AOL and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.280
dial up modems.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.420
Funny thing is technology has
changed quite a bit since then.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810
But the technology
behind browsers has not.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.390
In fact today's modern web browser
still support the same technology that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.060
the original Netscape Navigator
had back in 1994.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.320
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.480
You were joining a crazy world.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.700
One that simultaneously
stays the same yet changes.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.360
In fact is changing faster
today than it ever has before.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.999
Let's see how.
