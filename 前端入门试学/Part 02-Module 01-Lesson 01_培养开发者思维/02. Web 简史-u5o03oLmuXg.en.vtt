00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.370
I'm in one of the Udacity
tablet studios.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.330
Any time you see this pen,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.980
you are actually watching a video
that's taking place right here.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.990
Anyway, back to the subject at hand.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.580
Unfortunately we can't teach
you everything there is

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.110
to know about the world
of web development.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.100
At some point you'll be on your own and

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.470
you'll need to learn some
new technique or technology.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.940
So instead of focusing directly on
teaching you everything that you could

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.040
ever know, we want to make sure that
you're ready to be independent.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.900
We want you to be able to
figure out new techniques and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.820
technologies on your own and thrive in
what ever the web dev world becomes.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.910
So, to start all of that off,
I want to go back to the very beginning.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.470
Some of you may recognize this.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.100
This is Netscape Navigator indeed
it was the first major web browser.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
It was released in 1994 and it was
based on the earlier Mosaic browser.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.430
Which was developed by the University
of Illinois back in 1993.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.450
Of course navigator peaked in
popularity in the 90s, and eventually

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.460
Microsoft's Internet Explorer came to
dominate the web browser landscape.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.520
Development on Navigator stopped.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.650
But you can still trace features in code
in older versions of Internet Explorer

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.900
in Mozilla's Firefox all the way
back to Netscape Navigator.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.850
In fact Netscape Navigator looks
pretty similar to the browsers that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.540
we still have today.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.148
There's a URL bar at the top and
then a big viewpoint to consume content.

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:38.608
Nowadays web developers use three
different languages to develop websites.

00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:42.080
HTML, which stands for
Hypertext Markup Language.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.850
CSS, which stands for
cascading style sheets.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.820
And JavaScript, which,
well I guess just stands for JavaScript.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
In a nutshell,
HTML describes the content and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.000
structure of a website,
CSS describes the styling of a website.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.410
And JavaScript handles
all the interactions.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.830
You'll be learning all about
these three languages.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.570
In the lessons to come.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.959
However, this situation with HTML,
CSS and

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.590
JavaScript hasn't always been the case.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.830
The early web was almost
entirely all text documents

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
with maybe a couple images,
kind of like newspapers.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.910
As a result the first
browsers only supported HTML.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.540
CSS and JavaScript didn't exist yet.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.100
Believe it or
not this is the first web site.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.030
The web wasn't originally designed for

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.280
big applications like Facebook and
Gmail.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.580
It was developed as a way for

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.750
text documents to directly
link to one another.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.760
You can see all of
the links on this page.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.820
The links were meant to mimic references
that you would find in bibliographies or

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.590
annotations in research papers.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.920
In fact the academic route should be
pretty obvious because this website is

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.130
from CERN.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.340
Which is the nuclear
institute in Europe.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.170
At the time, these links were really
nothing more than ways of referencing

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.920
other people's work.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.830
Check it out.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.900
This was the first Microsoft home page.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.900
Over time developers started
adding styles to their content.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.650
Changing colors and fonts and
backgrounds and a little bit of layout.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.620
All of these changes
ended up in the HTML.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.240
And the code was a huge mess.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.850
Now you're looking at the Yahoo
homepage around the year 2000.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.420
This image is actually courtesy of
the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.360
Which is a kind of
hilarious way to check out

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.990
older websites if you want to
see how the web used to look.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.190
Anyway, CSS came on
the scene around 1996 as

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.980
developers really wanted to add more and
more and more styles to their pages.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.020
With CSS, developers could
then separate these styles,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.050
like deciding how all of these
will look, from the content.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.600
Which is essentially all
of the text on this page.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.360
Of course, that's just HTML and CSS.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.580
Then there is JavaScript.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.040
JavaScript is a different
beast all together.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.530
While HTML and CSS are markup languages.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.350
And that is to say, they're only
used to describe other documents.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.910
JavaScript is a full on
programming language.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.810
It allows developers to
change the content and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.600
the style of a live web site.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.100
JavaScript has had
an interesting history.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.690
It was developed in 1995 by
a guy named Brendan Eich.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.920
And he did it in ten days.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.030
That is crazy.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.050
You may not know much about
programming now or maybe you do, but

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.550
either way that is an impressive feat.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.620
He created JavaScript to
run in Netscape Navigator.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.780
Today, JavaScript runs
in every browser and

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.410
is one of the most popular
programming languages period.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.738
Thanks to the popularity of the web.

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:03.888
JavaScript runs in a huge number of
environments outside of browsers.

00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:07.364
Including servers with
software like Node.js and

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:09.980
microcontrollers like Tessel.io.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.880
All right, and speaking of popularity,
it's easy to assume that

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.910
JavaScript is an offshoot of
the programming language Java.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.690
Because of their similar names.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.950
Java was hugely popular in 1995 and
in fact it still is today.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.840
As it turns out though, Java and
JavaScript are in no way related.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.980
I mean,
there are a couple syntax similarities.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.530
But that doesn't change the fact that
the name JavaScript was basically just

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.490
a marketing decision to
piggyback on Java's popularity.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.990
True story.
