00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.660
All right, I'll go ahead and
start with the first one.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.109
It looks good, but it doesn't have
the slash inside the closing tag, so

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.200
that one is incorrect.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.170
Next up, there is an element
nested inside a p element.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.430
Now you haven't seen before, stands for
emphasis, which just makes text italic.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.585
As it turns out there's actually nothing
wrong with this except for the typo.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:31.390
However, typos don't count as
incorrectly formatted HTML, so

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.120
this one's actually good.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.170
Then comes the third one, now notice
that it's all green and looks weird.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.330
This is a very good indication
that this one is wrong.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.750
I didn't include the greater than
sign here inside the opening tag,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.320
which made this whole thing a mess.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.070
Now one of the nice things about
code editors is that they will

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.830
change the formatting depending on
whether or not the syntax is right.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.520
So because the syntax here is wrong,
this is not valid HTML,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.860
this all looks weird in green and

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.410
it should be pretty obvious that
something needs to get fixed.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.280
The last one looks really
similar to the second.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.020
But there's a key difference.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.690
I switched the closing tags here.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.070
Now notice that the tag is being
closed outside of the p tag and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.980
the p tag's being closed inside the tag.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.410
That is wrong, this is a mess.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.180
The element is the child of the p
element, and as such, you have to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.740
open it and then close it inside the p,
like what's done right here.
