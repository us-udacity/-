00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.760
Okay, I'll start by looking for bold.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.280
To do that I will hit Cmd+F and
then search for bold.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.110
Now this brings me to a bold
faced element called &lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.060
That looks pretty reasonable, but

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.710
it may be hard to see there
is a second search result.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.650
So I'm going hit enter again. And
that brings me to the strong element.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.420
Now the strong element is
something that has importance and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.310
is typically displayed in bold.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.900
In fact I recommend using strong.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.860
Let me show you how that looks.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.870
So I've gone ahead and
wrapped the text with a strong tag and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.620
as I said the b would be
fine too if you did that.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.420
And then I've saved it and I will come
over to the browser and hit refresh and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.970
then wallah the text is bold.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.160
Okay next up.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.050
I need to make this text emphasized.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.560
Back inside the Mozilla developer
network I'm going to search for

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.109
emphasis.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.850
There we go.
And that quickly takes me to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.290
the em element which you saw before.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.740
The element marks that something
has a lot of importance and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.030
so that looks good to me.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.000
You'll also note that right underneath
it you'll have something called i.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.490
I will make something
italic incidentally.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.520
But you actually aren't supposed to
use the  element for any itallics.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.850
It actually has a different purpose
now which you can read about here.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
Let me show you how
the element looks.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
So, i've added the opening
tag and the closing tag.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910
Around This content.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.690
And then I'll come over to
the browser and hit refresh.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.550
And there you go.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.000
This text is now emphasized.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.340
Incidentally, in the next lesson
you'll be learning another way

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
of making text bold and italics.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.010
I hope you remember that there are many
ways to accomplish a lot of tasks

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.730
inside the browser.
