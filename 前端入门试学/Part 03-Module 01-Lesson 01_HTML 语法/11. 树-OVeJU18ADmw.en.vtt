00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.910
Redwoods grow in damp, foggy forests.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.420
They collect a lot of their water
from fog, and, in the process,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.530
they help keep the surrounding
environment wet.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.350
If we were here in the morning, with a
lot of fog in the air, you'd be able to

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.040
see water droplet's beading on leaves and
then dripping down to the ground.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.470
Anyway.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.620
The reason I want to show you trees
is because they play a key role in

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.600
web development.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.540
Besides being beautiful
awe inspiring giants,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.570
web developers use them to represent
the data that makes up websites.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.100
Here, let me show you what I mean.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.400
This is a family tree.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.500
You've probably seen
something like this before.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.970
There's a parent.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.690
And two children.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.270
And yeah.
I know it takes two parents to make

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.260
a kid but, just ignore that for now.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.540
Pretend it only takes one parent.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.340
For this family, you would say that
Diego and Jamal are children of Zhalisa,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.590
and you would say that Zhalisa is
the parent to Jamal and Diego.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.920
You could also say that Diego and
Jamal are siblings.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.500
We use the same kind of family
terms like child, siblings and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.850
parent to describe relationships
like these inside a data tree.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.750
Now a tree is just a type of
data in computer science.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.460
They're used to represent
hierarchical data.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.400
That is to say, bits of information
that belong to each other.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.420
In this case, element 3 and
element 2 both belong to element 1.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.300
And just like a family,
the children can be parents too and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.360
that's it, that's a tree.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.090
I brought this tree up because your HTML
turns into a tree a lot like this one.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.450
Elements will belong to each other or
be descended from one another.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.150
There are children and parents and
children have children.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.180
Now I know that can sound
a little confusing so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.550
here, let me show you what I mean.
