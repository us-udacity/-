00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.080
You are looking at an HTML document, and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.860
this is what this document
looks like inside the browser.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.100
The similarities should
be pretty obvious.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.860
You can see this is a heading
here inside the HTML, and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.120
you can see the same, this is
a heading here inside the browser.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.240
There's a lot here.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.880
But I don't want you to
worry about everything.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.350
Right now just pay attention
to what you see right here,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.390
which is coming inside these two tags.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.080
That's a body.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.084
This thing right here with , this is
a heading, and is an HTML element.

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:39.906
And this is a special kind of
element called h1 element.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:44.100
H stands for heading, and
one means it's the biggest.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.860
That means that there are h2,
h3, h4 tags and so on, and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.280
they're all smaller then each one.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.840
Specifically, this part is called a tag,
the part with an angle bracket h1,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.250
and then another angle bracket.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.340
There are many tags in HTML.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.580
Here's a p tag, here are some span tags,
and this is an image tag.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.610
Each one of these represents
a different kind of element.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.440
This p, inside this tag,
stands for paragraph.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.190
This whole thing is called
a paragraph element.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.800
Notice that this whole element
has two tags, here and here, and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.970
these tags are slightly different.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.820
There's an opening tag, and
there is a closing tag, and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.780
notice the closing tag
has the slash in it.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.650
Between the opening and
the closing tag comes the content.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.540
This content is generally what
people will see inside the browser.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.300
So here are a few different elements.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.826
Notice that the text in both
tags is always the same.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:49.226
And notice that they all
start with a less than sign,

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:54.324
they all have some kind of text in here
indicating what type of element this is,

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:57.130
and then every tag has
a greater than sign.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.621
And just to point it out again, closing
tags have a slash inside them, but

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.510
otherwise they look the same.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.120
And the slash always comes right
here after the less than sign.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.600
And then together,
everything here represents an element.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.230
There are some elements, like images,
that are slightly different.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.240
Notice that images do
not have a closing tag.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.290
And that's okay.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.410
It's a special one that you'll
learn more about later.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.860
This is a conceptual way of
representing the same element.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.260
In this case,
the content belongs to the paragraph.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.570
The content in a way is
a child of the paragraph.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.220
This is going to be useful later.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.940
Don't worry about it now,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.060
but I just wanted to show you because
you'll be seeing more trees like this.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780
For the time being, I want you to
write your first HTML element.
