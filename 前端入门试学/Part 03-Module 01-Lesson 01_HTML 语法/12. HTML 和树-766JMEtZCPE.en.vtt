00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:04.278
Okay, so you already know
how to create an element.

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:07.798
So, how do you get from here to here?

00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:10.138
The answer is content.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:15.248
As it turns out,
elements can go inside other elements.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:19.718
Content isn't just text,
it is also other elements.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:24.428
So this is a new tag,
it's a div which means division.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:28.783
A division element, or we just call
them divs, are used to group chunks of

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:33.088
content together and you'll be learning
a lot more about divs later on.

00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:37.848
But either way,
inside this div comes an h1 element.

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:41.978
This h1 is a child of the div.

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:45.848
Here, let me reorganize to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:49.588
I've moved the h1 to its own row and
I've tagged it in.

00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:55.388
This makes it really clear that
the h1 belongs to its parent div.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:01:00.258
You can see that the h1 comes between
the opening and the closing div tags.

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:04.018
You'll need to use this same
format when you're writing HTML.

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:06.978
Let me go ahead and
add another element to the mix.

00:01:06.978 --> 00:01:09.798
Okay, pause for one second.

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:14.178
What do you think the tree
from this HTML looks like?

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:15.798
What's the parent?

00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:17.698
What are the children?

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.278
What are the siblings?

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:22.198
Okay, I'm going to pause for
a second and let you think.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.078
Here it is.

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:33.843
You can see that the div is
the parent of the h1 and the p,

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.998
and that h1 and p are both siblings.

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:41.048
So just to be clear,
this is the code that you write and

00:01:41.048 --> 00:01:43.658
this is a way of thinking about it.

00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:44.651
As I keep saying,

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.038
it's going to be really handy
later on knowing that your code.

00:01:48.038 --> 00:01:49.398
Turns into this.

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:54.257
Of course, as you're writing your code,
the trees that you create with HTML

00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:57.258
can grow as wide or
as deep as you need them to be.

00:01:57.258 --> 00:01:58.550
It doesn't matter.
