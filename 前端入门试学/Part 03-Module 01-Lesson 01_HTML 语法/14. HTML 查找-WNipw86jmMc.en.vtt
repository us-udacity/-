00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.920
For this quiz, I want you to
do a little bit of research.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm giving you a link, below,
to the Mozilla Developer Network.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.480
It has an HTML element reference
that is a super useful tool for

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.510
every web developer.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.960
In fact, I encourage you to use Mozilla
Developer Network whenever you want to

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.030
look something up.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.650
In fact, I want you to practice now.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.460
I'm going to give you this html.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.410
I want you to search for bold in
emphasis, over here, in your browser.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.785
Just use the find function, which is
either going to be a Cmd f or Ctrl f.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.365
And then once you've found out
how to make something bold or

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:39.755
emphasize it, do that over here.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:43.695
Make this text bold and
then emphasize this text.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:44.565
Good luck.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:45.265
I know that you can do it.
