00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.427
I'm in the Santa Cruz mountains
in Northern California, and

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:10.111
these are redwood trees.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:14.232
Redwoods are huge, unbelievably huge.

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:15.052
The ones behind me,

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:18.450
look like they're about 50 meters tall,
it's kind of hard to tell.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.000
But the biggest in the world is
115 meters tall, that's 380 feet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.440
As i said,
these trees are absolutely enormous.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.040
I want you to remember this scene, and
especially the shape of these trees.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.980
We'll be coming back here later on.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.690
Trees are going to be a recurring theme
throughout your web development career.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.948
In fact, at times it may even feel
like your life revolves around them.

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:45.378
Anyway, I think it's time to
start diving into some code.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.480
I'm going to start by showing
you the basics of HTML.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.340
You'll be writing code at first
inside the Udacity classroom, but

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.390
later on in the lesson you'll be using
a text editor specially made for code.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.620
All right, let's get started.
