00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.077
[SOUND] I love getting out
here in the environment.

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:06.730
It is so much better than sitting
in a stuffy office all day.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.560
For the next part of this lesson,
you'll be setting up your environment.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.309
Now the environment here consists of all
the living things and natural processes.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.410
Your development environment
consists of all the software and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.690
code that's available to either you or
the code that you're running.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.530
The first two aspects of your
environment that you need to set up

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.920
are your browser and your text editor.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.710
But before you go installing anything.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.770
Hold on a second.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.400
I want to clarify a few things first,
one,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.220
you will be using a text
editor to write code.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.490
When you read, text editor,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.890
you might think about a piece
of software like Microsoft Word.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.130
But our text editors for coding
are different, Word shows you rich text.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.770
Rich text is formatted with fonts,
and styles and colors etcetera.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880
You want to write plain text for code.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.340
This is just a set of ascii characters.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.420
You should never, ever,
ever use Microsoft Word for coding.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.420
The code that you write should not
be styled, it is just plain text.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.770
Okay and point two.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.620
Sometimes you might hear the term IDE
thrown around as a place to write code.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.400
IDE stands for
integrated development environment.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.730
Apple's Xcode and Microsoft's Visual
Studio are two examples of IDEs.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.790
You can think of an IDE as
a text editor on steroids.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.360
Besides allowing you to write code,
they will also compile it and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.640
then run your code for you.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.800
Beyond that they also have a number of
other features that you wouldn't find in

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.520
a text editor.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.380
IDE's are incredibly useful, but

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.460
they aren't really ever used for
web development because of browsers.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.130
Browsers will run our code and
we actually don't have to worry about

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.890
compiling anything, that's just
not a thing with web development.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.610
I recommend staying away from IDEs for
the time being,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.690
unless you happen to already
be familiar with one.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.730
Okay, it's time for
you to set up your environment.
