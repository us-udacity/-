00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.350
Redwoods live for millennia.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.590
The record is like 2,200 years.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.010
But it's not uncommon for
trees like that one.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.030
Or this one that I'm sitting on, to
live for upwards of hundreds of years.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.885
So enjoy a brief introduction to trees.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.420
In the next part of the lesson, you'll
be doing a problem set where you'll be

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.640
applying everything that you've learned
about building websites so far.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.620
If you run into any problems,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.110
just think back to your plan
from the first project.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.934
You have all the tools, techniques and

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.208
support that you need to
push through anything.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.068
In the meantime, congratulations.

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:34.030
You've taken a huge first step in
your career as a web developer.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.870
Okay, well maybe it's not
as big as these giants.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.730
But still, you should be proud.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.770
After you finish up the problem
set in the project after that,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.000
you'll be learning about style and
how to add it to your website.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Good luck.
