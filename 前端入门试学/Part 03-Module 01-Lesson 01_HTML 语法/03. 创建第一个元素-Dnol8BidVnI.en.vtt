00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.570
So this is what my solution looks like.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
I put each of the three elements on its
own line because I think it's easier to

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.930
read like this.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.790
Either way it is actually
valid one line or

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.760
three lines but
I like this way a little bit more.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.250
Notice that I have opening tags and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.510
closing tags with content in between for
each of my three elements.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.270
Also notice that my closing tags
look different because they

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.300
all have a slash here
after the less-than sign.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.210
So let's see how this looks.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.358
I've saved my file and I will come over
to the browser and I will hit refresh.

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:41.370
And there you go, notice that
the p tag that says I'm Cameron

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.440
is all on its own line,
there is nothing next to it.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.050
But the two spans that
say I like teaching, and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.930
web dev :) are all on the same line.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.330
Remember, this is a paragraph,
so it wants to be by itself.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.630
But spans are part of a line,
so they are part of a line.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.660
That's why I left this space right here.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.000
So, that goes to show
you a couple things.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.460
One, is that it's really not
too bad writing these things.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.650
And two, every type of element
will display differently.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.140
You'll be learning all about
the different elements and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.250
the way that they display later on.
