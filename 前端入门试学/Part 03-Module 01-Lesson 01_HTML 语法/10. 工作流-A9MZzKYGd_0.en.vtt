00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.980
Here's what you're going to
do with your workflow.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.119
First off, you change your code or
you edit it inside a text editor.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.080
Once you're happy and
you want to see what happened, you save.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.970
Very simple.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.765
I recommend using a keyboard shortcut
like these, which is Cmd+S on a Mac, or

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:18.760
Ctrl+S on a PC.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.370
This will make your life a lot easier,
instead of going up to the menu and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.110
clicking one of these options.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.150
Then you swap over to your browser.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.190
You.
You open the file

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.190
if you haven't done it yet.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.350
But, if it is already open all
you need to do is then click

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.610
refresh to see the changes.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.820
Here, let me show you and
example from start to finish.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.360
First off, I have my text editor open
and I also have my browser open.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900
It's kind of nice to have
the two open at the same time so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.340
you can see everything that's going on.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.020
But, you don't have to.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.520
Inside my text editor
I've made a change.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.830
Notice that I added an h2 tag which is
going to be another heading tag just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.940
a little bit smaller than the h1.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.120
I'll go ahead and save it,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.800
and notice here inside Adam,
that little dot disappears.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.569
So, now I know my file has been saved.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.520
I use the keyboard shortcut
because that's a lot faster.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.300
Now I'm ready to see
how this file looks.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
So, I'll come over to Chrome.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.300
And I will press Cmd+O to open a file.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.770
I will navigate through my computer and
then find it.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.376
I've called it lesson2.html.

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:24.770
And I'll click Open.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.585
Hey, and there you go.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:30.895
You can see the header here and
it's the same code that's over here.

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:32.185
Looks pretty cool.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.695
So what if I make a change?

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:38.900
What if I decide to change this
exclamation point to a question mark?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.530
Because for some reason I'm not sure.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980
It is though, I know this is HTML.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.160
I'll save it, and then I'll come over
to the browser and I'll refresh.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.510
Now, I could click this
refresh button here, but

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.660
it's actually a lot faster to
use the keyboard shortcut.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.700
So I'll hit Cmd+R.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.720
And now, there is a question mark.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.470
All right, and
that's all there is to it.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.450
There are a few other ways of
opening files in the browser,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.930
but this is going to be what
you'll be doing for now.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.700
Later on, you'll actually learn about a
few tools that can do the refreshing for

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920
you every time you save.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.050
That's pretty cool.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.270
And then there are also developer
tools that will let you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.030
edit websites live without
even using a text editor.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060
You'll be learning about
developer tools very soon.
