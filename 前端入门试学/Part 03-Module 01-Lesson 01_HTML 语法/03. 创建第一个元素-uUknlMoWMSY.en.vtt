00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.950
For this quiz I want you to
practice writing your first HTML

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.010
elements kind of like this one.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.970
And just a reminder,
this is the structure of an element.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.840
There's the opening tag, the content
which is going to be text here and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.970
then the closing tag and notice
the closing tag has the slash in it.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.770
Okay, here's your challenge.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.960
For this quiz I want you
to create three elements.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.500
And i want one of them to be a paragraph
and then two of them to be spans.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.080
The names paragraph and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.050
span tell you a little bit how these
two elements will look on the page.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.695
A paragraph is a literal
paragraph like from writing.

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.995
It's a big block of text that is
separate from other pieces of text.

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:47.435
A span is like a line of text and

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.715
it isn't really separate
from other pieces of text.

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:53.610
Try playing around with both of
these tags to see how they look.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790
And when you're working
on your elements,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.370
you can put whatever content
you like inside of them.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.510
It doesn't matter so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
long as something is there,
your answer will be counted as correct.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.570
And you may be wondering if you can put
all the elements on the same line of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
text, or
if they need to be different lines.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.100
My advice is to try both and
then see what happens.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.760
All right good luck,
I know you can do this.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.880
All you need to do is type out tags just
like this one but with paragraphs and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.840
spans, and you'll be okay.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.520
You've got this.
