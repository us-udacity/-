00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.600
All right, here's a quiz for you.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.435
I've got some HTML here.

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:09.550
What I want to know is which chunks
of HTML are formatted incorrectly?

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.250
That means,
which one of these are wrong.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.400
Take a look through these HTML and
decide which one needs some correction.
