Hello, China!

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.533
Welcome to the new Front-End Foundations Nanodegree Program. 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.733
In just a few months' time, this program will provide you

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.600
with a strong foundation to become a Front-End Web Developer. 

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.066
At Udacity, we do our best to teach skills 

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.033
that are relevant to the technology industry,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.233
and especially to the evolving job market. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.333
That's why we developed this Front-End Web Developer program 

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.900
in close collaboration with Google and GitHub, 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.433
as well as AT&amp;T and Hack Reactor. 

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.534
We even have guest appearances from industry leaders

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:34.367
like Pete LePage and Sam Dutton, both are developer advocates at Google.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.767
In this Nanodegree program, 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.033
you'll learn the fundamentals of how the web works,

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:42.500
and gain a working knowledge of the three foundational languages

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.066
that power each and every website: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.066
Using these three languages, 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.667
you'll do everything from building your very own portfolio website 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.266
to developing an interactive resume application with JavaScript. 

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.700
Sound challenging? Good! 

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:00.667
Stick with us and let the learning begin.
