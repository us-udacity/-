00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.860
Hi there. I'm Anthony, and I'm the product lead for 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.814
intro to self-driving cars here at Udacity.

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm excited to help start your journey towards becoming a self-driving car engineer.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.310
There's a lot of work that goes into making this great Nanodegree program.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.120
And we want to take a few moments to introduce

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.550
you to the team who helped make this possible.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.940
Hi, I'm Andy. I'm the curriculum lead for this project.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.350
I've been teaching and learning at Udacity for five years.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.685
And self-driving cars are a world changing technology.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:31.495
And the mathematics and computer science principles that underlie them are fascinating.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:34.790
I really can't wait to introduce you to this incredible world.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.525
Hi, I'm Cezanne Camacho.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.820
And I'm a content developer at Udacity.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.250
I'm an expert in computer vision which is how machines,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.890
like self-driving cars, visually perceive and respond to the world.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.660
And I'm excited to teach you about vision and other foundational programming,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.085
and math concepts that

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:53.905
all self-driving cars rely on when they make decisions on the road.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:56.575
Hi, I'm Elecia White.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.230
I'm an embedded systems engineer with

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.180
over 20 years of experience in all sorts of industries.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.195
I wrote "Making Embedded Systems" for O'Reilly.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:11.110
And I host embedded.fm - a podcast about the many aspects of the engineering.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.760
I'm here to help you understand why

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.375
C++ is so important in the development of self-driving cars.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.420
Hi, I'm Tarin. I'm a director of AI here at Voyage.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.289
And I'm super excited to joining a classroom and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.150
teach about machine learning and computer vision.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.460
Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm the program manager for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
your Nanodegree program as well as for the self-driving car engineer Nanodegree program.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.060
I'm really looking forward to having you in the program,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.530
and really excited for you as you start this journey.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.050
If you ever need anything from me,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.680
you can come find me in Slack community.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.740
Hi, I'm Erika.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.450
I'm a student experience coordinator.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.845
Feel free to ping me on Slack,

00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:48.220
or email at support@udacity.com

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.510
There are even more people behind

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.250
the scenes that are doing everything they can to make

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000
this program great. Now, what do you say we get started?
