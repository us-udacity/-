00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the Nanodegree program.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.060
&gt;&gt; We both worked individually on the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.439
&gt;&gt; I worked on courses called,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.255
Path Planning and Localization.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:11.820
&gt;&gt; And I worked on Lane Finding and Computer Vision.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.723
&gt;&gt; When we released the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program,

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.370
there was a ton of interests from students and industry.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.820
But it turns out that building a self-driving car isn't easy,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.414
and so many of the courses were approached from a very technical standpoint.

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:26.960
&gt;&gt; And some people who enrolled in that program,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.940
found themselves blocked by things like math notation,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.675
programming concepts, and programming languages.

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:35.039
So Andy, who do we make this curriculum for?

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.695
&gt;&gt; The person we had in mind when we designed this curriculum,

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:39.465
has some programming experience,

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.130
maybe 40-hours or so.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.465
They're comfortable with algebra,

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.495
and they hopefully get some enjoyment from thinking through,

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:47.039
and solving hard problems.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.649
Even when those problems use math.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.894
&gt;&gt; If this describes you,

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:52.575
and you're looking to fill that gap,

00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:56.625
or just get more experience with the programming and math behind self-driving cars,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:01.119
this program will prepare you for the more advanced curriculum. So let's get started.
