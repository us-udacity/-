Hi my name is Sebastian,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.574
and along with a talented group of people here at Udacity and from our industry partners,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.839
I shall be your friendly instructor for this Nanodegree program.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.780
Now we put this together to make the basics of self-driving cars very accessible.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.390
You'll be given a chance to learn about data structures and basic math,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
different programming languages, planning, perception control,

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.574
base rule, and stuff like this firsthand and write

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:33.935
computer code that effectively implement a very basic version of a self-driving car.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.820
When you're done, you can consider yourself very

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.174
knowledgeable of self-driving cars because you've learned all the basics.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:44.039
There's a advanced version available at Udacity that I'll talk about later,

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.615
that goes into more depth.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:50.365
But consider yourself one of the very first pioneers learning about self-driving cars.

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:52.109
So, let's meet the team.
