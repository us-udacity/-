00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
So, when I write code,

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:03.620
sometimes I make mistakes.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.429
Honestly, this happens to everybody,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.439
even the most experienced programmers.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.320
Fortunately, pretty much all programming languages

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.019
have mechanisms for detecting our mistakes,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.829
and letting us know about them by displaying error messages.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.000
Error messages not only draw our attention to the problem,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.425
but they also often give us information to help us diagnose the issue and fix it.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:29.580
For instance, Python will display an error message that

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.695
tells you what line an error occurred on,

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:35.575
and what kind of error took place.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:38.265
You'll see a message such as name error,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:42.460
or syntax error, and it'll always come with a line number.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.655
Now the line numbers aren't always entirely correct.

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.064
Sometimes they're off by one or two,

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:50.659
but they're usually a really good guide to

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.625
where to start looking for the error in your code.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.015
Up next, we have a piece of code that has a number of bugs in it.

00:00:58.015 --> 00:00:59.765
As you work with this code,

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:02.480
you'll fix the bugs and the line numbers on

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.879
the error messages will guide you to just where you need to put your attention.
