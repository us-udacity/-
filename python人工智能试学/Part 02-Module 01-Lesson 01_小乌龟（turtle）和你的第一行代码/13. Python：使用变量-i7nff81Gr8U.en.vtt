00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
Earlier on, we talked about the idea of an assignment statement,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.570
like for example any equals turtle.Turtle.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.230
It takes whatever's on the right hand side of

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.535
the equals sign and it assigns it to the variable that's named on the left.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.210
In this case, the code on the right creates

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.164
a new turtle object and this turtle object gets assigned to the variable named amy.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:27.664
But we don't have to limit ourselves to Turtle objects,

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:30.559
we can assign other things to variables too.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.359
For example, this statement assigns

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.894
the string yellow to a variable called a pretty color.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.870
Let's see how we might use something like this.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.634
Here's our familiar code that has the turtle "Draw a yellow square."

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:49.809
Only we'll change it a little by adding this assignment statement right here.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.140
Now that we've assigned the string yellow to this pretty color variable,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.365
we can use that variable any place in the code where we need that string.

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.829
So, instead of putting yellow here on this line,

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.489
we can put pretty color instead.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.179
That will have exactly the same effect.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.010
The turtle will draw a yellow square.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.740
One of the nice things but doing it this way is

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.229
that we can use that variable in multiple places.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.150
Like if we also had some other turtles drawing some other shapes,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.350
we could use the same pretty color

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.539
variable to set the color that they're drawing as well.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.340
Then if we decided that we didn't think yellow was such a pretty color after all,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.075
we could change the string that's assigned to the variable.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.880
Like, let's say that now instead of assigning the string yellow,

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.655
we'll assign the string, light blue.

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:45.885
So now this name pretty color will refer to the string light blue instead.

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:51.210
The nice thing is that we only have to modify this variable in this one spot,

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.969
but this string will be getting used in all of these different places.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.189
So all of these turtles are now drawing in light blue.
