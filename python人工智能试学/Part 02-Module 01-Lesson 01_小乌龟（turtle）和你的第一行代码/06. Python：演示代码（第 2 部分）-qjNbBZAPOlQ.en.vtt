00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
So, here's our code again with the turtle's named

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.904
consistently changed from George to Amy.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:09.630
Now line three says something about our turtle and the color

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.385
yellow which makes sense when we look at what the program does,

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:14.810
it draws a yellow square.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.850
Now it's interesting that yellow is in quotes,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.655
nothing else in this program seems to be in quotes.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.015
This line also has parentheses in it just like most of the other lines.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.300
Parentheses must be really important,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.160
there all over the place.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.534
Now, let's play with the code to see if we can figure out what more of these things do,.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.184
That word Yellow really stands out.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's try changing it.
