Hey there, and welcome to these lessons on programming in Python.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:05.455
We're glad to have you with us.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:09.969
In this course, you will be writing programs in the Python programming language.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.130
There are many programming languages in the world today but Python is one that has

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
a great reputation for being both easy to learn and very practical.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.545
Python code can run on any major kind of computer today.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:27.780
From a Windows PC or a Mac to a high-powered Linux server or even on

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.109
your phone and Python is used in all sorts of fields

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.850
from Web development to data analysis to artificial intelligence.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.545
The skills you'll learn here are central to your journey to becoming a programmer.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:44.000
Many of the concepts you'll learn in these lessons are not limited to Python.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.649
We'll go over some of the most fundamental building blocks of programming, ideas,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.049
and skills that will be useful for you no matter

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.039
what area of programming you're interested in pursuing.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.839
In the next few lessons,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.050
the programs you'll work on use a feature called Turtle Graphics.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.489
The turtle is an imaginary robot that can draw colorful shapes on the screen.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.214
This way, you can quickly tell what your programs are doing.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.120
Learning to code is only partly about learning

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.270
the grammar of a programming language such as Python.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:18.144
It's mostly about learning a way of thinking about patterns, repetition,

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:23.280
processes, and information and the Turtle gives us a way to visualize that.
