It is my absolute pleasure to introduce you to my amazing colleagues,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.765
who will guide you throughout this program.

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.769
Juno Lee is a former data scientist,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.054
who built neural networks for optimizing users shopping experiences.

00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:20.245
In this program, Juno will focus on programming tools specifically Python,

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:24.265
one of the most widely used programming languages in the industry.

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:29.815
Juan Delgado, a computational physicist with a Masters in Astronomy.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.760
He previously worked for NASA,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.780
developing space instruments using machine learning techniques.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.875
Juan will teach you some of the programming tools you will need to know.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:45.230
Mike Yee, who holds a Bachelor's of Science in mathematics and statistics,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.504
and received his PhD in cognitive science.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.540
Mike will teach you Matplotlib,

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.839
the most mature Python package for data visualization.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.005
Jennifer Stab, holds a PhD in Computer Science,

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.535
and Masters in Bio-statistics,

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:05.674
and was a university Professor of Analytics and Computer Science.

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:10.670
Jennifer will take you step by step through some of the labs in this nano degree.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.049
The labs will be short implementations in code,

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.194
of the theory you will have learned before.

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:23.064
Grant Sanderson, is a creator of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown,

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:28.149
which is dedicated to teaching math visually using a custom build animation tool.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.675
He was previously a content creator at Khan Academy.

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:36.614
Grant will bring you the beautiful visual world of linear algebra.

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:41.109
Luis Serrano, who worked as a machine learning engineer at Google.

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.939
He holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan,

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.894
and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Quebec at Montreal.

00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:54.474
Luis will teach you all you need to know about neural networks.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:57.734
Mat Leonard, a former Physicist,

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.079
Research Neuroscientist and Data scientist.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.709
He completed his PhD and Postdoctoral

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.289
Fellowship at the University of California in Berkeley.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.730
You will see Mat throughout the program in various lessons such as Pytorch.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:18.318
He will also help you create your first project at Udacity, in image classifier.

00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:23.604
We are very proud of our diverse community of teachers in the school of AI,

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:26.759
and can't wait to start teaching you.
