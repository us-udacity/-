00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
If we have a turtle called Amy,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:09.569
then the statement amy.forward(50) causes that turtle to move forward by 50 pixels.

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:16.625
Similarly, amy.back(50) causes the turtle to move backwards by 50 pixels.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.500
One thing that's important to understand when writing

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.554
turtle programs is that the directions are all from the turtles perspective.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:26.550
This can be a little bit confusing at

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.984
first when you tell the turtle to turn left or right.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.723
At any point in the program,

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:36.334
the turtle is facing in a particular direction.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.625
When you tell the turtle to turn left by 45,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:45.700
you're telling it to turn left by 45 degrees from the direction it's currently facing.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.195
So, if we want the turtle to draw a square,

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.759
we have to tell it to go forward 100 pixels,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.739
then turn left by 90 degrees from its perspective,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.695
forward 100, left 90,

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:04.105
forward 100, left 90, forward 100,

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:09.840
and now it's back to where it started although it's facing in a different direction now.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920
This can sometimes get a little confusing.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.844
For example, if you want to draw a triangle like this,

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:20.349
you might be thinking of having the turtle turn by

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:24.375
these angles inside the triangle which are 60 degrees.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:31.370
But actually, you want to have the turtle turn by these angles which are 120 degrees.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.950
Of course, if you get confused or if you're not quite sure,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.764
you can always experiment.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:42.119
Don't be afraid to try different angles to see what results you'll get.
