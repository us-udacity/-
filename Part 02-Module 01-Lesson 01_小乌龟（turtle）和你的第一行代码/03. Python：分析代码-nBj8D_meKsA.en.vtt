00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
Let's take a look at this code starting at the top with the very first line,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.890
import turtle. Now what could that mean?

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:11.309
In English, import means to bring something in from somewhere

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.820
else like importing cookies from Denmark or coffee from Peru,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.179
and we've heard that turtle is a name for

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.789
this imaginary robot that can draw on the screen.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.689
So, maybe this line is bringing us a turtle from somewhere.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.940
For now, you probably have no idea where

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.690
the turtle is coming from and that's completely okay,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.300
it's probably not from Peru.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.579
Next, the story seems to be introducing a character named George.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
The second line says George equals turtle.Turtle.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.140
It kind of sounds like this is saying George is

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.590
equal to a turtle or maybe a double turtle.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.265
Usually in English, we'd say that George is a turtle.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.895
Let's experiment with the code and see what we can figure out.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.880
Something we can do if we don't know what the code does

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.675
yet is to try changing things and see what happens.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.399
For instance, there might not be

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.325
any particular reason this turtle has to be named George.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.480
Let's try changing the turtle's name from George to something else like Amy.
