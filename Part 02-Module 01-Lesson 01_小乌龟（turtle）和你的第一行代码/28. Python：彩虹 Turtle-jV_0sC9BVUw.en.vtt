00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
In this exercise, we'd like you to take what you know about looping and turtles,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.155
and draw something of your own.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.919
But specifically, we've given you a list of the colors

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.775
of the rainbow and we'd like you to draw something rainbow colored.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.685
You can use a loop over this list to draw a shape with different colored sides.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:24.009
Here are just a couple of examples of shapes that you can create with a loop like that.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.070
You could make a hexagon,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.289
whose sides are just different colors,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.750
or you could take some time and figure out how to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.335
draw a rainbow or you could do something totally different.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.799
After you try it, we'll show you the code for both of these.
