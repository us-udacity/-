00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
So, here's another thing that we could do with this list of rainbow colors.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:09.910
This turtle draws six different colored stars and here's how it does it.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.419
From the top, we start out by defining a turtle and setting the turtles width to five,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.280
so they'll be nice and vivid.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.060
I'm setting the speed to zero which is the fastest just so it will draw very quickly.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:27.179
Then we have the loop for color in rainbow.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.210
So, this color variable is going to get each one of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.075
these values coming from the list each time we go through this loop,

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.895
red, then orange, then yellow, and so on.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:41.840
The first thing we do inside the loop is set the color of the turtle and then,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.370
we have a nested loop for side in 1, 2, 3,

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:49.334
4, 5, while this is just drawing a single star.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:51.530
Then after drawing one star,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.870
the rest of the loop moves off to the position for the next star.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.924
Turns right by 60, picks the pen up,

00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:05.200
scoots over by 50 pixels to go from one star over to the place for the next star,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.885
and puts the pen down.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.020
Then, when we go to the top of the loop,

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.409
we get a new color and draw a new star.
