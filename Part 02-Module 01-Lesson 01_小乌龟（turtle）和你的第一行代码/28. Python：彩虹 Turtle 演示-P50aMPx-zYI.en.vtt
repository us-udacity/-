00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700
So, this exercise asked us to use this list of colors to draw a rainbow shape.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.030
In this video, I'm going to show how to make

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.669
a hexagon where each side is a different color.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.689
Since there are six sides and a hexagon and six colors in this list,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.039
there will be one color for each side.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.929
The first thing we need to do is add code to create a new turtle.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.509
Then we can write the code to draw a hexagon.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.700
Now, we already have done something like that from

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.914
an earlier lesson but we just haven't made it rainbow-colored yet.

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.530
When I'm experimenting with something new and I'm not quite sure how to do it,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.710
I'll often start with whatever parts I know pretty well how to do and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.109
then work step-by-step from there toward what the new thing is.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.519
So for now, I'm not going to worry about the rainbow part.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.090
I'm just going to start by drawing a simple hexagon.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.845
To do that, I'm going to use a for loop.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.469
Since the hexagon has six sides,

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.905
I'll have the loop run six times.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.285
I can do that by using a list with six items like this.

00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:59.384
Each time the loop runs,

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:01.129
I'll have the turtle go forward by

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.280
100 pixels which will be one of the sides of the hexagon.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.195
Then it needs to turn.

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:07.459
As we saw earlier,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.549
we can get the turning angle for any regular polygon by dividing

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.969
360 degrees by however many sides the shape has.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.924
Three hundred and sixty divided by six is 60

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:20.409
so I'll have the turtle turn right by 60 degrees.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.319
So, at this point we should have functioning code that draws a hexagon.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.929
Whenever I get to a point in my code where I

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620
think it should run and have some visible results,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.905
I like to test it to make sure it's working how I expect.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.680
That way I could catch any little errors that I might have made while I was working,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.350
and yeah, it looks like it's drawing a hexagon.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.319
It's so little hard to see because it's using such a thin black line.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.869
So one little thing I can change,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.329
is make the line thicker using the width method.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.545
Now we need to think about changing the color.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:58.265
First, I'll start by just setting a single color like we've done before.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.775
I also don't particularly like the hexagon's off-center.

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:03.725
It's kind of down off to the right.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.809
So, I'm going to have the turtle back up a little before it starts drawing.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.590
I now hide the turtle when it's done drawing just so that

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.819
we don't have a little arrowhead shape sticking out of our shape.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.105
So now we need to think about how to get it to

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.164
change its color every time it runs through the loop,

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:25.304
and we know that we want to use this list of colors here.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.420
More specifically, we need to use a different one of

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.189
the colors in this list every time the loop runs through.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.379
The trick here is to use the loop variable.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.824
Right now we have a loop variable named side,

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.619
and each time the loop runs,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.099
this variable gets assigned a number from this list.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.489
One through six.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.750
But we're not doing anything with these numbers.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.935
We're just using the fact that there are six of them.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:54.090
However, this rainbow list also has six items in it.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.134
So, we could replace our list of numbers with that list of colors,

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.479
and our program shouldn't really do what it's doing.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.949
It should still draw a hexagon just like before.

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.884
Now, since each of the items in this list is a color,

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:13.294
I'm going to change the name of the variable from side to pretty color.

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:16.549
I called it pretty color rather than just color because I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.515
didn't want to confuse it with the color method.

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.909
Now each time the loop runs,

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.819
the pretty color variable will be getting a different color from the list.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.709
First red then orange then yellow and so on.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.670
But we're still not doing anything with these colors.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.039
So when we run the code,

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.229
we just get a plane red hexagon and all we need to

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.840
do is to set the color based on that pretty color variable.

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.319
So now each time the loop runs,

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.500
we're passing a different color to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.354
the color method which is then used for one of the sides,

00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.229
and there we go.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.759
A rainbow hexagon.
