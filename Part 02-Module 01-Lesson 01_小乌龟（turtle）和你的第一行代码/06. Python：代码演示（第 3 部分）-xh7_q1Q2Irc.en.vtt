00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.844
Next, we have the line for side in [1, 2,

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:08.519
3, 4]: Notice also that this line ends in

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.494
a colon and there are two lines indented underneath it.

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:17.289
So this first line seems to be saying something about the four sides of a square,

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.460
and both of those two indented lines start with the turtle's name, Amy.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.019
One of them says, amy.forward(100) and the other says amy.right(90).

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.189
Now, go back and run this program again but this time watch the turtle closely

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.649
with these lines of code in mind and try

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.439
to see what these lines are making the turtle do.
