00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.075
Here's some code that draws a square.

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.980
Notice how we're using the same lines over and over again here,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.054
and that's just for a square with four sides.

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:14.085
What if we wanted to draw a shape with say a 100 sides?

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:17.820
That's a lot of work and it turns out it's not necessary.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.829
Using a four loop,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.050
we can draw a shape having as many sides as we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.269
want and it will only take three lines of code.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.210
To create a for loop,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.975
we start with a line like this;

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:31.990
for side in [1, 2,

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:42.420
3, 4]: then we follow it with the code that we want to loop or repeat.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.590
Notice how we indented these lines by moving them four spaces to the right.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.145
This is how we show that these lines are inside the loop.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:55.850
In other words, it's these indented lines that will get run repeatedly.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.234
So, this code will run multiple times,

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.924
but how many times?

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:06.739
Well, notice the four something in something else structure in this line.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.920
Essentially, it is saying run the code in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.835
this loop one time for each of the things in this list.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.299
Since there are four items in the list,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.795
the loop runs four times.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:20.435
For this particular loop,

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.320
it doesn't really matter what the items in the list are.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.929
We could change these numbers or even replace them with strings.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.710
Again, the loop runs one time for each item in the list

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.359
and it's because there are four items in the list that the loop will run four times.
